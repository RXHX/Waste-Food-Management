# FoodManagement System #

This  project aims to develop an android app to reduce food wastage by providing services
of sharing food at low prices.
 
The food wastage reduction App is designed to facilitate both
customers and restaurant managers. There are two modules one for the restaurant manager and the other for the customer/user. 

 ## Restaurant Manager ##
The restaurant manager can upload extra food details by using
this app.


     Functionality
   
  Restaurant managers can register, log in, add/remove extra food details, view orders, send
   reminders (for food pick up or delivery), and view and edit the order details.

 ## Customer ##
The customers can find the restaurant nearby and search for food available at low prices
at the particular restaurant. Using this app, customers can interact with a restaurant and request
food.
    
    
     Functionality 

The customers can register themselves, log in, view/edit their profiles, search for a restaurant
nearby, choose a restaurant, view and choose available food items, choose delivery or pick-up
service, view order details, receive a reminder for food pick-up or delivery, view order details and
view order history/reports.



## Scenario ##

1.  In the Food Sharing app, each user will be required to register on the app. 
2. At registration time, the
user will be asked for the information including name, address, cell number and email. 
3. The user
will be provided with a user name/email ID, which will be used to maintain the record of each
unique user. 
4. The app should start with a welcome screen. The app should ask a user to log in with
a username and password. 
5. If a user is new, he/she should first register. Once the user is logged in,
the app should display the “Search for a Restaurant”, “Order Food”, “View an Order Details and
Status”, “View Order History”, “View/Edit User Profile” and “Log out” options.
6. If the user selects “Search for a Restaurant”, new activity should open asking the city to search for.
Entering the city should display a list of available restaurants. 
7. Choosing one of the restaurants will
open a new activity and will display a list of food items available from that particular restaurant
along with discounted prices. 
8. Choosing one or more food items and clicking place the order button
should take you to another activity and will ask for a pick-up and delivery option. After choosing
all the required options, the app should confirm the order and the price.
9. If the user selects “Order Food”, it should take the user to the search for a Restaurant page/activity
and proceed with the required steps.
10. If the user selects “View an Order Details and Status”, a list of orders should be displayed. 
11. Clicking
one particular order should show order details and status.
